# Release 1.0.0
This channel will be used in the future to highlight file and documentation changelogs for each game update.

Also, it will provide a collection of identified breaking changes for modders.

The underlying system/engine is comparable to Victoria 3 or Crusader Kings 3.
So if you want to get a head start take a look at their modding wikis:
- https://vic3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding
- https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding
## Script Documentation
The script documentation contains all effects, triggers, and so on that can be used to define your own logic.
I have added a _rough_ category of the docs to them, but if you want to have a more expanded explanation,
it is best to check out the Victoria 3 or Crusader Kings 3 wikis on these.
- [Effects](docs/effects.log) (Execution Methods)
- [Triggers](docs/triggers.log) (Conditional Methods)
- [Event Targets](docs/event_targets.log) (Context Switching and Value retrieval)
- [On Actions](docs/on_actions.log) (Game Hooks)
- [Modifiers](docs/modifiers.log) (Buffs and Debuffs)
## Type Documentation
The developers also provide type documentation for _some_ types.
I have collected them, and you can find them in this repository.
- [Types](types)

> **NOTE** As with all documentation, there are some errors, field omissions, and so on. So be prepared to run into those when the game releases and compare the provided documentation to the game files if in doubt.
