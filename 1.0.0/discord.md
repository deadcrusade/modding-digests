# Release 1.0.0
This channel will be used in the future to highlight file and documentation changelogs for each game update.

Also, it will provide a collection of identified breaking changes for modders.

The underlying system/engine is comparable to Victoria 3 or Crusader Kings 3.
So if you want to get a head start take a look at their modding wikis:
- https://vic3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding
- https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding
